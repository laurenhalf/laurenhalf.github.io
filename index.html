(TJM-4 Milwaukee)</p><h2 id="narrative">Narrative</h2><p>The dataset explored is part of the U.S. Freeze Seasons, 1917-2017 dataset from  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was released in October 2017 by by ProPublica in collaboration with the Associated Press. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/first-fall-last-spring-freeze-noaa">Link to Dataset</a>.</p><p>The National Weather Service records the dates of the first fall season freeze and the last spring season freeze at hundreds of weather stations around the country each year. The Associated Press has collected data from 700 of the most complete locations between 1917 and 2017, and combined it with additional geographic information about the location of each station, calculated the mean and median for each location, and appended a NOAA-provided probability of first freeze dates, based between 1981 and 2010.</p><p>According to the AP, the data shows that the date of the first freeze of the year has fallen further down the calendar over the last several decades. In 2016, the average first frost day at the included stations was two weeks later than average, while the last frost of spring was nine days earlier.</p><p>I used the build-in component we explored in class: <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/scroller">the Scroller</a> to scroll some of the data information over a image depicting a fall freeze from the Farmer’s Almanac website. </p><p>I loaded the data to begin the embedded vega-lite plot, but got an error as the years were not in string form so I added ’year<em>xxxx’ to the <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->0 <!-- -->years of labels to avoid the error. All of this worked for me on Idyll at first and then I randomly started getting the error: Error lexing input, unexpected token: ′    What I was trying to plot was a comparison of each county’s thirty</em>year<em>median vs. the noaa</em>normal projection. I believe the code is correct, but couldn’t see the output. I  attached the text file.</p><h1 id="data">DATA</h1></div></div></div></div>
